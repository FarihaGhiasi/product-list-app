# Product List React App

## Overview

This project is a simple React application for managing a list of products. It allows users to view a list of products, search for specific products, and add new products to the list (only the form). The project was created as a technical interview task to demonstrate skills in React and Material-UI.

### Use of External API

The application leverages the [DummyJSON Products API](https://dummyjson.com/products) to dynamically fetch product data. This API provides a convenient way to simulate a real-world scenario of fetching and displaying product information in a React application.


## Features

- Display a list of products with basic information.
- Search for products based on their titles.
- Add new products to the list (only the form).


## Files

- ProductService.js: Handles communication with a dummy product API using Axios.
- ProductList.js: Manages product data, search, and a dialog for adding new products.
- App.js: Application entry point integrating the ProductList component.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Material-UI
- External API: [DummyJSON Products API](https://dummyjson.com/products)
